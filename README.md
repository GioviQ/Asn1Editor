# Asn1Editor
Includes a library and application to manipulate, read, and create ASN1 keys, (pfx, der, pem, etc).

-------------------------------

The good stuff (ASN1 parser etc) is in /LCLib, the rest are various user-friendly applications to read and convert keys to different formats. I couldn't find the source online anywhere, so this is uploaded here for historical purposes. It is identical to the original code, and I won't be accepting any pull requests.
